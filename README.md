**`Full-Stack Web Developer (Front-End/Back-End/Data Science)`**

I am a full-stack web developer and data scientist at Better Bettor. I specialize in sports modeling/forecasting by using machine learning algorithms and other techniques primarily in Python. All of my work is done from the ground up, from planning and desiging pipelines/workflows all the way to final product realization/implamentation.
